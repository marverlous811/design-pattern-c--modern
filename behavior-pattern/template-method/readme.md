Template Method

The Strategy and Template method design pattern are very similar, so much so that, just like with Factories, I would be very tempted to merge those pattern into a single Skeleton Method design pattern

The diffenece between Strategy and Template is that Strategy uses compostion, whereas Template Method uses inheritance.
