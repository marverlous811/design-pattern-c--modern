State Design Pattern is a very simple idea: state controls behavior; state can be changed; the only thing that the jury is out on is  who triggers the state change

- States are actual classes with behavior and these behaviors switch the actual state form one to another

- states and transistions are just enumerations. We have a special component called a state machine that performs the actual transistions
