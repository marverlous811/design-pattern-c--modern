## 1. Motivation

- Complicated object (e.g car) aren't designed from scratch

  * They reiterate existing designs

- An existing (partially or fully constructed ) design is a prototype

- We make a copy (clone) prototype and customize it

  * Requires "deep copy" support

- We make the cloning convenient (e.g via Factory)

### Prototype is a partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of

## 2. Sumary

- To implement a prototype, partically construct an object and store it somewhere

- Clone prototype

    - implement your own deep functionality

    - serialize and deserialize

- Customize the resulting instance
