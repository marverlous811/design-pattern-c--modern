# 1. Single Responsibility 

- A class should only have only one reason to change

- Seperation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems

# 2. Open/closed 

- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

# 3. Liskov subsititution

- you should be able to substitle a base type for subtype

# 4. Interface Sergregation

- dont' push too much into an interface; split it into separete interface

- YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It

# 5. Dependency inversion

- High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstraction
